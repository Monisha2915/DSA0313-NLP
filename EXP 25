#DESCRIPTION#:
Import the openai library to interact with the GPT-3 API.
Assign your OpenAI API key to the openai.api_key variable to authenticate your requests.
Create a string variable prompt that contains the initial text or query you want GPT-3 to complete or respond to.
engine: Specify which GPT-3 model to use (e.g., "text-davinci-003").
prompt: The text prompt that you want to complete or extend.
max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens (words or pieces of words) to generate in the response.
Access the generated text from the response object using response.choices[0].text.
Print the generated text after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.

#CODE#:
import openai

# Set your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'

# Define the prompt
prompt = "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away,"

# Generate a response from GPT-3
response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-003",  # You can use different engines like "davinci", "curie", etc.
    prompt=prompt,
    max_tokens=100  # Adjust the max_tokens parameter as needed
)

# Print the generated text
print(response.choices[0].text.strip())

#OUTPUT#:
prompt = "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away,"

The queen had a secret garden where the most beautiful flowers grew, and it was said that anyone who visited the garden would have their deepest wishes granted. One day, a young traveler stumbled upon this hidden paradise, unaware of the enchantment that awaited him. His journey was about to take an extraordinary turn...
